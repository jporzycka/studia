Implementation of Emergency Services Fallback to EPS, Service Request triggered

DESCRIPTION:
AMF sets Emergency Services Fallback Indicator (EMF) IE in Registration Accept towards the UE.
After receiving a Service Request with the Service Type indicating “Emergency Services Fallback”, 
the AMF includes the Emergency Fallback Indicator in:
	- Initial Context Setup Request for UE in IDLE mode,
	- UE Context Modification Request for UE in CONNECTED mode,
to the NG-RAN if the following conditions are all met:
	- The “5GC Voice Support” feature is enabled.
	- Emergency fallback is enabled (PLMN config)
	- Core network type “EPC” is not restricted in subscription data
	- N26 is enabled (PLMN config)
	- RAT type “EUTRA” is not restricted in subscription data.
	- UE supports S1

Otherwise, the AMF sends a Service Reject with 5GMM Cause#9 “UE identity cannot be derived by the network” to the UE.

Once AMF has sent the Initial Context Setup Request / UE Context Modification 
Request to RAN, it will start a timer to wait for the response.

Once AMF has received a successful N2 response, the Service request procedure will be successfully 
concluded.

If a failure response is received or N2 timer expires, no Service Reject will be sent. For UE in 
IDLE mode, AMF will initiate N2 release. The AMF ends the Service request for Emergency Services 
Fallback procedure and returns to the previous state.
