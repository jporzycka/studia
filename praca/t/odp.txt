1. encryption supi to suci -> registration request to AMF ->
AMF sends authentication request to UDM -> UDM sends 
authentication response (after supi check after suci decryption)
-> registration accept if ok

3. AMF - Access and Mobility Management Function
AMF receives connection info from UE, is responsible 
for example for UE registration, authentication and mobility. 

   SMF - Session Management Function
Is responsible for all messages related to session management.

interfaces: UE --N1,N2--> AMF 
	    AMF --N11--> SMF

   gNodeB - 5G base station, it provides 
connectivity to UE, in 4G was eNodeB

   UDM - Unified Data Management, similar to HSS but for 5G

   HSS - Home Subscriber Server, 4G, has subscriber data,
responsible for example for authentication

4. AMF - Access and Mobility Management Function

   5GS - 5G System
   5GC - 5G Core Network
   
5. (?) User Equipment

7. High speed, low latency, greater capacity

8. SMF, UDM, PCF, AMF

9. N* (?)

10. Namf (?)

11, 12. registration, authentication, mobility, handovers

13. NR initial access procedure (establishing connection with 
the gNodeB?)
